# LiteBans messages.yml generated by version __VERSION__

# The following variables can be used in most messages that involve a punishment:

## Punishment specific variables ##
# $id - The ID of the punishment in the database.
# $type - Type of punishment - ban, mute, warn, kick.
# $reason - the reason for the punishment
# $displayName - the moderator's name, or their display name (/nick) if this is enabled in the configuration
# $permanent - whether this ban is permanent
# $ipban - whether this is an IP-ban
# $silent - whether this was executed silently (-s)

## Punished player specific variables ##
# $player - player name, only available in certain contexts, see existing messages.
# $uuid - UUID of punished player
# $geoip - Country of affected player, requires GeoIP to be enabled in the configuration, won't work with imported bans

## Dates ##
# Example format: "2017-02-03", depends on time_format
# $bannedFrom - execution date
# $bannedUntil - expiration date

## Durations ##
# Example format: "20 days, 5 hours, 2 minutes". If permanent, "forever", if expired, "expired" (both are configurable).
# $duration / $banTimeLeft - time until expiry
# $originalDuration - the full duration of the punishment.
# $timeSince - time since placement


## Placeholders ##
# These variables represent messages in this configuration (messages.yml)
# $base - banned_message_base
# $appealMessage - banned_message_appeal_message

## Global variables ##
# $activeBans, $activeMutes, $activeWarnings - total number of global active punishments
# $totalBans, $totalMutes, $totalWarnings - total number of global punishments (including inactive ones)

# Any message can be disabled by setting it to "". Empty messages will not be sent by the plugin.
